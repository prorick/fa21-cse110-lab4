# Part 2


### Answers:
1. Prints out 3 to console because i goes to 20 and then exit the for loop i becomes 3.
2. Prints out 150 because the last price is 300 and the discount is 0.5, so the discounted price is 150.
3. Prints out 150 because the final price is 150 since the original price is 300 with a discount of 0.5, so final price is 150.
4. The function will return the final discounted prices. In this case it will return [50,100,150].
5. Error because i is outside the scope of where it is declared in the for loop. 
6. Error because discountedPrice is outside the scope of where it was declared inside the for loop.
7. Prints out 150 because the final price is 150 since the original price is 300 with a discount of 0.5, so final price is 150.finalPrice is within the scope of where it was declared.
8. The function will return the final discounted prices. In this case it will return [50,100,150].
9. Error because i is outside the scope of where it is declared in the for loop. 
10. 3 because the length of prices is 3
11. The function will return the final discounted prices. In this case it will return [50,100,150].

    1.  A: student.name
    2.  B: student["Grad Year"]
    3.  C: student.greeting()
    4.  D: student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    5.  E: student["courseLoad"][0]

    1.  A: '32' because of String conversion so '3' + '2' is '32'
    2.  B: 1 because of Numeric conversion so 3-2 is 1
    3.  C: 3 because of Numeric converstion so 3+0 is 3
    4.  D: '3null' because of String conversion '3'+'null' is '3null'
    5.  E: 4 because of numeric conversion 1 + 3 is 4
    6.  F: 0 because of numeric conversion 0 + 0 is 0
    7.  G: '3undefined' because of string conversion '3' + 'undefined' is '3undefined'
    8.  H: NaN because undefined becomes NaN in numeric conversion so it is NaN

    1.  A: true  because '2' becomes 2 which is greater than 1
    2.  B: false because of dictionary comparison. The char value of '2' is greater than char value of '1'.
    3.  C: true  because '2' becomes 2 which is equal to 2.
    4.  D: false because === is a strict equality operator and 2 is a number and '2' is a string. 
    5.  E: false because of true becomes 1 which is not equal to 2. 
    6.  F: true  because of Boolean(2) returns true
15. === is the strict equality operator, so it checks the equality without type conversion. For example 0 == false evaluates to true because false is numerically converted to 0. However 0 === false evaluates to false because the types are different (comparing number to boolean)

17. The function will return [ 2, 4, 6 ]. Basically, the array being modified is [1, 2, 3]. For every element in the array, the callback lets us call the function doSomething which returns the value 2 times the element. The NewArr being returned is thus [ 2,4,6 ].
